I am a Lecturer in Digital Environment at <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/">School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>. Previously, I was a Senior Research Scientist in Computer Vision at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, London Research Center, UK. The techniques I have developed/involved have been shipped to several products. I received the PhD degree from Imperial College London, where I worked on hand pose estimation. My research interests are machine learning and computer vision, particularly 3D digital humans and computational photography. I am an Associate Editor for The Visual Computer journal. I regularly review for major computer vision conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and NeurIPS) and related journals (TPAMI, IJCV and TIP).

#Hello, this is shanxin :)
#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a #picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing #`profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your #[publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-#Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, #LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
